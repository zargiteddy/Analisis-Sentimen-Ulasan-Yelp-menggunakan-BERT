review,sentiment
"The Food is great with many different flavors with different spice levels, different kinds of fries and there homemade ranch is amazing!! highly recommen!",5
The best alitas! The Service It's weird that I can't order something while I'm there.,5
"If you look at all the reviews online, you would think this place is a front as so many people have complaints of never receiving their food. Fortunately, the food gods were merciful and our order of wings came at the expected time.Ordered 75 wings (garlic parm, lemon pepper and spicy korean) with an order of parmesan and regular fries.Having tried a lot of fast food buffalo wing places, Wingstop sits below average. The flavors were okay, but the wings themselves had very little meat and was primarily crispy skin. The fries themselves were also soggy. Would I come back? Only if I was back in my college years and had the midnight munchies with nowhere else to go.",3
"Do not order from this location. There's a woman there that is extremely rude. They messed up on my order and at first she was like ""oh is your name ___"" and I said no, she was like ""are you sure it's for this location"" and I said yes and showed her my email receipt. Then she proceeded to tell me it was out for delivery???!! Delivered where because I never approved delivery and it says carry out on my receipt. She then said ""well they are making you a new one"" like my time was just available all day. No sorry we messed up, no accountability. Who ever she is needs to be fired for poor customer service.",1
"They charged me $40 for 10 boneless wings... I tried requesting for a refund, since I only ordered 10 wings, but nobody was responsive or helpful about it. The place was also very unorganized and had no system at all. It kinda felt like the workers hated each other, so this Wingstop location was just all types of messy. I love Wingstop, but this location was not worth it. I never got that $40 back even though I called so many times about it.",1
Idk what that place is but it is not a wing stop. I'm pretty sure it is a drug dealing house with an odd coverup. You can't actually order food there and it's just a pop up warehouse that says food court. When you go inside there is a desk with a touch screen on it that gives you a bunch of restaurants to order from but it doesn't actually work. Don't know what I just came across but I'm pretty sure I was not supposed to see it. Very sketchy.,3
"Wingstop Downtown!?!? In the SoMa? Next to/behind the EndUp? Yeah, this place is going to be HOT since to its close by neighbors who live in residential, a few bars, and is downtown. I ordered online since I saw ads online saying they have a new location so I definitely had to come by for a vibe check. It looks and smells like Wingstop! I ordered one thing and came a little 5 minutes after I received a text saying it was ready to be picked up. There is a very large counter you walk up to and pick up or order your food. I didn't explore much into the building to see if there were any seating areas, but there was a parking lot for food pick ups/delivery service providers. A couple of bites into my meal and I'm so relieved to say that it's pretty legit. My food remained warm when I returned home (I walked). I'll update this review after investigating whether or not they've got indoor seating and when I actually order wings. I'll definitely be back once my cravings kick in! Yay.",1
"My ratings are never this low.  I was on their site and wanted to pre order wings for an event on the 17th of November.  I put down the date and time and submitted my request.  After I submitted my order, I get a confirmation that 150 wings and fries are on its way to be delivered at 145pm.  I attempted to call their phone number over 6 times and no answer.  Finally someone suggested that I call Door Dash.  Door Dash was able to contact someone in their Georgia customer service.  They (Door Dash and the customer service rep ) said they would cancel my order.  Well, the driver delivered the wings, I did not take my order and gave the driver a tip.  Going to call my credit card company today to get a credit on my credit card.  I never had their wings and the staff was excited to have it on Thursday.  I decided to support another business for my order that I placed in person.",1
Awful service I placed wings for delivery and the driver literally looked me in the eye shook his head and drove away from me with my food in hand. Tried calling multiple times to the restaurant for a new order or my money back and got no response not even a ring. If you want to get scammed then this is definitely the place to eat,1
when you order online the food is not ready on time. the people messed up my order. i came back and waited over 20 minutes to make a damn sandwich. the parking here sucks and it's in a small dark alley. don't recommend coming here.,1
